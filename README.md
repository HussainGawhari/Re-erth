To run this project using docker command using

        ["docker run -it client_admin"]


        CRUD Operations Completed:
        I've successfully implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for Ir application. This means I can now create, retrieve, update, and delete client records in  system.

        Pagination Implemented:
        I've added pagination to  application, allowing I to retrieve and display data in smaller chunks or pages. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, improving performance and user experience.

        Querying by Various Parameters:
        I've implemented the ability to query client data based on various parameters such as last name, city, country, and postal code. This empowers users to filter and find specific client information more effectively.

        Password Hashing Implemented:
        I've ensured the security of user passwords by implementing password hashing. This means sensitive user data is protected, and even if Ir database were to be compromised, actual passwords would remain hidden.

        User Authentication Completed:
        I've successfully implemented user authentication, allowing users to securely log into Ir application. This is a crucial aspect of security and access control, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
